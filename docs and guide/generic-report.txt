2. Problem Statement

Managing finances is a challenge faced by individuals and organizations alike. Key issues include:
	1.	Lack of visibility into spending habits and patterns.
	2.	Inadequate tools that are either overly complex or fail to meet specific needs.
	3.	High subscription costs for popular financial management platforms.
	4.	Difficulty in consolidating data from multiple sources (e.g., bank accounts, credit cards).
	5.	The absence of actionable insights for saving money.

The problem is compounded by the lack of affordable, user-friendly solutions that cater to individual needs and provide AI-powered financial recommendations.
